# vechain-proxy-deploy
This repository provides a simple web-based tool for deploying proxy contracts on the VeChain blockchain. It allows users to input a smart contract bytecode and an implementation address to deploy a proxy contract using Connex and Web3.js. The tool supports both the VeChain Testnet and Mainnet, with a built-in network switch.
